            <p>
                Enterprise software systems have become more sophisticated, relying heavily on distributed components like cloud services and microservices. Chaos engineering plays a vital role today in creating resilient distributed systems.
                <br>
                </br>
                This article walks you through the concept of chaos engineering, its importance, and its core principles. Additionally, I’ll explain the tools widely used today for chaos engineering and delve into the benefits and challenges associated with chaos engineering practices.
            </p>

            <h2 id=whatischaosengineering>
                What is Chaos Engineering?
                <a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#whatischaosengineering>#</a>
            </h2>
            <p>
                Chaos engineering is the practice of intentionally injecting faults into a system to test its resilience. The goal is to identify potential failure points and correct them before they cause an actual outage or other disruption. By proactively testing how a system responds under stress, we can identify and fix failures before they end up in the news. Chaos engineering can significantly increase confidence in the resilience of distributed systems, particularly in unforeseen conditions. We literally “break things on purpose” to learn how to build more resilient systems.
            </p>
            <h3 id=whywouldwebreakthingsonpurpose>
                Why would we break things on purpose?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Think of a vaccine or a flu shot for instance COVID 19, where we inject ourselves with a small amount of a potentially harmful foreign body in order to build resistance and prevent illness. Chaos Engineering is a tool we use to build such an immunity in our technical systems by injecting harm such as latency, CPU failure, or network black holes in order to find and mitigate potential weaknesses.
                According to the chaos engineering report, the most common outcomes of Chaos Engineering are increased availability, lower mean time to resolution, lower mean time to detection fewer bugs shipped to product, and fewer outages. Teams who frequently run Chaos Engineering experiments are more likely to have >99.9% availability.

                What's the role of Chaos Engineering in distributed systems?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Distributed systems are inherently more complex than monolithic systems, so it’s hard to predict all the ways they might fail. The eight fallacies of distributed systems that programmers new to distributed applications invariably make.

                Fallacies of Distributed Systems:
            </h4>
            <p>
                Distributed systems are inherently more complex than monolithic systems, so it’s hard to predict all the ways they might fail. The eight fallacies of distributed systems that programmers new to distributed applications invariably make.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>The network is reliable</li>
                <li>Latency is zero</li>
                <li>Bandwidth is infinite</li>
                <li>The network is secure</li>
                <li>Topology doesn't change</li>
                <li>There is one administrator</li>
                <li>Transport cost is zero</li>
                <li>The network is homogeneous</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            Many of these fallacies drive the design of Chaos Engineering experiments such as “packet-loss attacks” and “latency attacks”. For example, network outages can cause a range of failures for applications that severely impact customers. Applications may stall while they wait endlessly for a packet. Applications may permanently consume memory or other system resources like Linux. And even after a network outage has passed, applications may fail to retry stalled operations, or may retry too aggressively. Applications may even require a manual restart. Each of these examples need to be tested and prepared for.
            </p>

                Benefits of Chaos Engineering
                <a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#benefitsofchaosengineering>#</a>
            </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Customer: The increased availability and durability of service means no outages disrupt their day-to-day lives.</li>
                <li>Business: Chaos Engineering can help prevent extremely large losses in revenue and maintenance costs, create happier and more engaged engineers, improve in on-call training for engineering teams, and improve the incident management for the entire company.</li>
                <li>Technical: The insights from chaos experiments can mean a reduction in incidents, reduction in on-call burden, increased understanding of system failure modes, improved system design, faster mean time to detection for incident management. </li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id=organizationsthatbenefitfromchaosengineering>
                Organizations that benefit from Chaos Engineering
            </h3>
            <p>
                Top tech organizations such as Amazon, Netflix, Microsoft, and National Australia Bank utilize chaos engineering to achieve a better understanding of internal systematic behavior and flaws. Chaos engineering can also help organizations to enhance the velocity of their continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines. Incorporating chaos engineering into CI/CD enables organizations to automate continuous experiments while controlling their potential impact.

                <li>Latency injection: DevOps teams intentionally create scenarios that emulate a slow or failing network connection. This includes the introduction of network delays or slower response times.</li>
                <li>Fault injection: This involves purposefully introducing errors into the system to determine how it affects other dependent systems and whether it interrupts services. Examples of fault injections include inducing disk failures, terminating processes, shutting down a host or introducing power or temperature increases. Fault injections can help organizations identify any single points of failure, which can cause the entire system to fail if something happens to them.</li>
                <li>Load generation: This relates to intentionally stressing the system by sending significant traffic levels well beyond normal operations. This helps the site reliability engineers (SREs) to understand any bottlenecks in the system, which in turn allows them to build more scalable systems. </li>
                <li>Canary testing: This involves releasing a new product or feature to a small group of users. That way, any glitches or bugs will only affect a percentage of visitors, leaving the rest of the audience to access the existing website experience.</li>

                Principles of Chaos Engineering
                <a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#principlesofchaosengineering>#</a>
            </h2>
            <p>
                Chaos engineering defines general principles to follow when designing and conducting experiments.
            </p>
            <h3 id=definethesystemsteadystate>
                Define the system’s steady-state
            </h3>
            <p>
                How does the system behave when it is steady? These definitions set the baseline for the experiments. The definition of steady state includes measurable outcomes defined using key performance indicators. Some examples of such KPIs are:
                <li>“The system latency is below 300ms.”</li>
                <li>“The error rate is below 3%.”</li>
            </p>
            <h3 id=createthehypothesis>
                Create the hypothesis
            </h3>
            <p>
                A chaos experiment needs a hypothesis on how the system will behave if a chaotic situation arises in a production environment. It should be based on the established baselines and knowledge of the behavior and weaknesses of the system. When creating a hypothesis, ask ‘what if’ questions or create statements on how the system should behave.
                <br>
                </br>
                Examples include:
                <li>“If we increase the load by 1x, the system can handle it without issue.”</li>
                <li>“An increase in request latency will not impact the user experience.” </li>
                <li>“If the primary database is down, the system will automatically failover to the secondary database with minimum downtime.”</li>
            </p>
            <h3 id=experimentbychangingrealworldconditions>
                Experiment by changing real-world conditions
            </h3>
            <p>
                Consider real-world scenarios or events that can deviate from the steady state.
                <br>
                </br>
                For example:
                <li>Events resulting in hardware and software failures.</li>
                <li>High-network latency and error rates.</li>
                <li>Network traffic spikes. </li>
                It helps identify vulnerabilities and ensures that the system can handle different scenarios.
            </p>
            <h3 id=runautomatedexperimentsinproductionenvironments>
                Run automated experiments in production environments
            </h3>
            <p>
                Prior systems like development, staging, and pre-production do not simulate the actual production systems. That’s why chaos engineering experiments run in actual production systems under controlled conditions.
            </p>

            <h3 id=minimizingtheblastradius>
                Minimizing the blast radius
            </h3>
            <p>
                Since chaos engineering experiments are conducted within real production environments, it is crucial to minimize any potential performance degradation or disruptions that customers may experience during their execution. The blast radius should be determined to use metrics:
                <br>
                </br>
                For example:
                <li>The number of affected users</li>
                <li>Impacted locations</li>
                <li>Workload quantities</li>
            Therefore, it is advisable to schedule these experiments during non-peak times and ensure the availability of backup systems for restorations.
            </p>

            <p>
                Chaos engineering tools are a relatively new approach to traditional testing methods used to establish confidence in systems. Software platforms will inevitably fail, and therefore it's critical to pinpoint weaknesses and fix them before they negatively impact business operations.Through the deployment of assumptions and successful chaos experiments, chaos engineering tools can provide a roadmap for uncovering infrastructural failures or unresponsive systems.
